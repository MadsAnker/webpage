CSS is short for Cascading Style Sheets.
We use CSS to add *styling* to webpages. 
Without it they would look very dull (and likely not be very useful).

CSS introduces the concept of *rules*, *selectors* and *properties*.
A rule is a set of properties that apply to a set of elements selected by a selector.
Using these concepts, we can selectively style elements on our page.
Let's see an example of simple CSS rule:

{% highlight css %}
.humongous {
    font-size: 100px;
}
{% endhighlight %}

`.humongous` is what we call a *class selector*. It "selects" all elements from the DOM with `humongous` set as their `classname` attribute.
Within the curly braces are the properties that will be applied to elements selected by the selector.
In this case, we set the font size to `100px`.

We can also select elements by their `id` attribute by using the ID selector.
The following would set the text color of the element with `id = "dabadee"`:

{% highlight css %}
#dabadee {
    color: blue;
}
{% endhighlight %}


We can also select by generic attributes:

{% highlight css %}
[rotation=upside-down] {
    transform: rotate(180deg);
}
{% endhighlight %}

We can also "nest" selectors to apply styling to children of selectors.
The following would set the height and width of all (that is what `*` means) children of the element with `id = "the-answer"`:

{% highlight css %}
#the-answer * {
    height: 42px;
    width: 42px;
}
{% endhighlight %}

There are way more properties and selectors than we have time to cover here.
[MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) has some great documentation available which can be used both for learning and as a reference.

## Using CSS
Let's use CSS to add some styling to our page. 
Our page would look a lot better if we added some background and a box containing the form for submitting guesses.
We probably also want to center the box on the page. 

To make the styling a bit easier, add two div elements surrounding the form like this:

{% highlight html %}
{% include_relative src/step2.html %}
{% endhighlight %}

The `#container` div will be the box that is centered on the page and displays the form.
The `#wrapper` element will help with centering of the `#container` div.

The simplest way to add CSS to our page is by introducing a `style` element in the header of our page like so:
{% highlight html %}
<head>
...
    <style>
        /* CSS goes here */
    </style>
</head>
{% endhighlight %}

Let's start by making the page itself fill all the available space. Add the following rule to the styles:

{% highlight css %}
html, body {
    margin: 0;
    height: 100%;
}
{% endhighlight %}

Now, expand the `#wrapper` div to fill the entire page and add the background:

{% highlight css %}
#wrapper {
    highlight: 100%;
    width: 100%;
    background: #ededed;
}
{% endhighlight %}

Next, fix the dimensions of the `#container` element and add a white background to it so that we can distinguish it from the wrapper background.
Let's also add some space between the elements of the container and the border by using the `padding` property.
Some shadow would probably also look nice. Add the following rule:

{% highlight css %}
#container {
    height: 500px;
    width: 300px;
    background: white;
    padding: 20px;
    box-shadow: 5px 5px 15px 5px rgba(0,0,0,0.25);
}
{% endhighlight %}

Great! Now we just need to center the container. There are several ways to accomplish this.
I find that the easiest way is often to add the following to the parent element:


{% highlight css %}
#wrapper {
    /* other properties */
    display: flex;
    align-items: center;
    justify-content: center;
}
{% endhighlight %}

The final page should look like this:

{% highlight html %}
{% include_relative src/step2.html %}
{% endhighlight %}

If we open it in the browser, we see the following:
![image-center]({% link /assets/img/step2.jpg %}){: .align-center}

Definitely better than before.
