JavaScript has quite a turbulent end interesting history.[^1]
Some people love it, some hate it.
Whatever your opinion about JS is, it is one of the most popular languages out there.
According to the [2022 Stack Overflow Developer Survey](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2022/#most-popular-technologies-language), it is the most commonly used programming language.

JavaScript was originally designed for and is still used for writing code that runs on webpages.
JavaScript run natively in your browser and has many convenient features for manipulating data on webpages.
For example, JavaScript makes it easy to write asynchronous logic, which is very commonly used for interacting with web servers.
We can also use JavaScript to manipulate elements on the page using the Document Object Model API (DOM) exposed by the browser.

The syntax of JavaScript is likely similar to other languages that you have seen before.
Let's start with a "hello world" example.

We can add JavaScript to our page by adding a `script` element to the `head` like this:
{% highlight html %}
<head>
    <!-- Other elements -->
    <script>
        alert("Hello world!");
    </script>
</head>
{% endhighlight %}

If we add this to our page, we will see a tiny dialog with the text "Hello world!" like this:

![image-center]({% link /assets/img/jshello.jpg %}){: .align-center}

The easiest way to play around with JavaScript is though the development console in your browser.
You can launch it by pressing `F12` (in most browsers) or by right clicking and selecting "inspect" (or similar depending on browser). 
Again, the [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) have great documentation available that you can use for learning and as a reference.

{% highlight html %}
<head>
    <!-- Other elements -->
    <script>
        function get_hint() {
            fetch("/get_hint.php")
                .then((response) => response.text())
                .then((text) => {
                    alert(text);
                });
        }
    </script>
</head>
{% endhighlight %}
